#For this project I downloaded National Hockey League (NHL) data from Kaggle
#Next, added the NHL database to the SQL software.
#I then performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#1. I determined the name, position, and nationality of players ordered by nationality.
SELECT firstname
, lastname
, primaryPosition
, nationality
FROM player_info
ORDER BY nationality;

#2. I determined the average penalty minutes (PIM) for the Blue Jackets using the like operator.
SELECT  avg(PIM)
FROM game_team_stats teamstats
LEFT JOIN team_info teaminfo
ON teamstats.team_id=teaminfo.team_id
WHERE teamname LIKE '%jackets%'

#3. I queried the data and got the name, position, and teamname of the NHL.
SELECT firstname, lastname, primaryposition, teamname
FROM game_skater_stats skater
JOIN player_info player
ON skater.player_id=player.player_id
JOIN team_info team
ON skater.team_id=team.team_id;

#4. I used the following SQL to find the goals, PIM, teamname and headcoach in descending order.
SELECT distinct date_time_GMT
, teamname
, goals
, PIM
, won
, head_coach
FROM game_team_stats teamstats
JOIN game
ON teamstats.game_id=game.game_id
JOIN team_info
ON teamstats.team_id=team_info.team_id
ORDER BY date_time_GMT desc;

#5 Found the name, team abbreviation, number of goals and position of players where goals scored >0 in descending order.
SELECT distinct firstname
, lastname
, abbreviation
, primaryposition
, goals
FROM game_skater_stats skater
JOIN player_info player
ON skater.player_id=player.player_id
JOIN team_info
ON skater.team_id=team_info.team_id
WHERE goals>0
ORDER by goals desc;
